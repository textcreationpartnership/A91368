            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the arrivall of our Pinnace, which is once more gone to ſupply them, having twice already relieved them. Proviſion begins to be here extremely dear, in regard of the multitudes that flock unto this place, and the great devaſtation of the Countrey round about. And we have not yet a competent Army to march with farre into the Countrey. There was news brought unto us the laſt night of an aſſured defeat given unto the Rebells at <hi>Limbreck,</hi> by one Maſter <hi>George Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> who is Conſtable of the Caſtle, and hath there 1000 Foot of his own Tenants, and two Troops of Horſe, which are commanded by two of his ſonnes, for the Guard of the City and Caſtle. On the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of this preſent, the enemy, to the number of 8000 men, marched under the conduct of one Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Geraldine,</hi> to take in this Place; and before they came within three Engliſh miles, ſent a Herald, to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it: The chief Officers of the City preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Counſell, to deliberate of the anſwer which they ſhould return to the enemy. And it was <hi>Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay's</hi> advice, that they ſhould pretend a readineſſe to render the City up unto them, upon condition that they might enjoy their goods and Eſtates peaceably, and without any moleſtation: and to this purpoſe they procured two ſerving-men, of whoſe fidelity they were well aſſured, to go unto the enemy, and declare the reſolution of the City. The men being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred, taking upon them to be Citizens of the beſt rank, who came thither to offer themſelves as pledges for the reall intentions of the City, gained ſo much credit from the Colonell, that without further delay, he taking theſe two with him, marched with about
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112080:3"/>
1500 men to the City, leaving the reſt behinde him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he came neer unto the gate, he found it open, and not any ſigne of oppoſition: and being met about a Muſquet ſhot from the gate, with divers of the chiefeſt Citizens, to receive his promiſe of peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enjoying their fortunes, which was condeſcended unto by him; he was entreated to march into the City with thoſe men which he brought with him, being deſirous they ſhould be there in Garriſon, for the Guard of the City. He finding them ſo (ſeemingly) reall, and ſuſpecting no fraud or treachery, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, accompanied with theſe Burghers, and his Souldiers following him, untill ſuch time as about 500 of them being entred, the Percullis was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately let fall, and Morters and Muſquets fired, as well upon thoſe that were come in, as thoſe who were without. The Colonell himſelf was ſhot in at the left eye, and thorow the head. There was alſo ſlain one Captain <hi>Butler,</hi> and another of the Geraldines, who was a Couſen to the Colonel, and had a Company under him: Captain <hi>Oroſe,</hi> Lievtenant <hi>Magroh,</hi> and divers other inferiour Officers, and not one man eſcaping of thoſe who entred, and very few of thoſe who were without, for as ſoon as the Muſquet ſhot which playd upon them from the Walls and Port had routed them, and put them to flight, the two Troops of Horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Maſter <hi>Courtenay</hi> his ſons, ſallied out, and cut off moſt of them. This famous overthrow was atchieved by the diſcretion and wiſedome of Maſter <hi>Courtenay,</hi> who lodged his ſouldiers ſo privately about the Port, that no notice was taken of them, untill the Watch-word was given; and then thoſe Burghers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112080:4"/>
which accompanied the Colonell, retired themſelves inſtantly into houſes on either hand, giving free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Shot (which was placed in convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) to play on the enemy. There were alſo ſlain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Officers of quality without the Town, in their flight, and to the number of 700 ſouldiers. I hope that this great and aſſured Victory will much quell their bold and barbarous attempts, and give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ours, to obtain more of them. Would your diſtractions in <hi>England</hi> would give leave unto the Parliament to ſend us ſome ſpeedy ſupplyes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes and Horſes, for we want neither men nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. I ſhall expect dayly to hear from you; and as ſoon as there is any thing worth writing, you ſhall not fail to receive.</p>
